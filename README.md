# RR-DHQA
Official repo for "A Reduced-Reference Quality Assessment Metric for Textured Mesh Digital Humans", ICASSP 2024.

# How to use the code

You can use `get_featrures.py` to extract the features of the textured mesh digital human in the `sample_dh` folder.

We also provide all the extracted features in the `features` folder for both reference and distorted digital humans from the SJTU-H3D and DHHQA databases.

You can use the `performance.py` to quickly reproduce the experimental results in the paper.
